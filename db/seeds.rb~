# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
indicators = indicators.create([{ name: 'Age' }, { name: 'Weight' }])
users.create(name: 'john', users: cities.first)
